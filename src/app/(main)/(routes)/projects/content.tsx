                planned, and with an active rebrand going on, we&apos;ll need some talented hands to keep this ship running.  
                This is considered one of our core projects, meaning it is essential to the CodeDevils brand and 
                identity.  We build our websites in Next.js and Typescript.  Next.js is a powerful framework for 
                JavaScript/TypeScript that handles frontend and backend deployments.  One primary focus of the 
                website&apos;s design is to keep the code maintainable, manageable, and readable.  We will not be building 
                web pages that are simply hard-coded in HTML, but are dynamic and rely on backend data structures to 
                function.

                We have a lot of fun features planned, many of them are just to show off our skills as programmers, 
                but we&apos;re here to advertise our organization and put our best foot forward to outside companies, 
                prospective contributors, and to the university we stand behind.  Our project is dedicated not to 
                being flashy, but to being robust and respectable to the community at large.  We aim to create a 
                website that is not just functional but also resonates with our audience, reflecting our dedication 
                to quality and professionalism.
                </p><p id='project-text'>
                We&apos;re seeking contributors who share our passion for technology and community. Whether you&apos;re a 
                seasoned developer, a creative designer, or even someone wanting to dip their toes into web design 
                and learn from us, you&apos;re in the right place.  If you&apos;re ready to make a meaningful contribution, 
                we invite you to join us. Whether you can dedicate a few hours or want to take on a larger role, 
                your efforts will help shape the future of CodeDevils.org. This is more than just coding; it&apos;s 
                about building a resource that empowers our community and showcases our commitment to excellence.

                Do you want to learn more about game development? Then the CD-GameDev project is for you. 
                We have decided to use the Rust programming language, a growingly popular, high-performance, 
                multi-purpose programming language that is sure to be a great tool to add to your skill set. 
                And although most games tend to use object oriented programming, we have opted to use a different 
                paradigm that is also growing more popular in the game dev world; Entity Component System (ECS). 
                This paradigm allows for major performance gains in compute heavy games, and also offers a different 
                way to think about objects in our game by separating data and systems. For this endeavor, we will be
                using the Bevy ECS framework, one of the best on the market.
                </p><p id='project-text'>
                One of the main drivers behind the decision of using Rust + Bevy, was that it is open-source, and 
                is turtles all the way down. In other words, everything is Rust from top to bottom, allowing us 
                to delve deep into how the Bevy ECS framework, and all its accompanying tools,  work under the hood. 
                We want to teach you about all the components that goes into creating and running a game, and traditional 
                game engines usually abstract all those details away. But that is not to say that Bevy is not easy to use. 
                After some practice, we believe you&apos;ll find that it is incredibly ergonomic and user friendly, thanks to 
                the amazing engineers contributing to the Bevy project.
                </p><p id='project-text'>
                The game itself will be inspired from the <span>
                    <a id='info-link' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania' target='_blank'>
                    metroidvania genre
                    </a>
                </span>, but might take elements from other genres as 
                well. It will be a 2D, side-view game, with a pixel art style. The features and systems we will implement 
                will evolve over time as we prototype and progress together. By joining this project, you won&apos;t just be 
                coding what we tell you to code, we also want you to be part of the discussion about where the game is headed 
                in all of its aspect, would it be features and systems, or story and lore.
                </p><p id='project-text'>
                The journey will be a challenging one, but will be very rewarding as well. You might have to learn quite 
                a few things before you can get started contributing, especially if you never coded in Rust or are new 
                to game development, but we will be there every step of the way, and we have curated a selection of 
                resources to help you get started using Rust and Bevy, so that you can start your game dev journey 
                with us as fast as possible. From things like how to handle asset loading, animations, handling audio, 
                to how game handles physics and graphics rendering, you&apos;ll come out of this project with a greater 
                understanding of all that comes into play when creating games.

                CD-Scraper is a project designed to teach the fundamentals of web scaping and the tools to make that happen. 
                The goal is to design a system for scraping job posting from various websites and serving the collected data 
                through an API build using SpringBoot. As this project is going to be based fully in Java, it is friendly to 
                those that are just starting off their programming journey.

                Throughout this project, contributors will have the opportunity to collaborate with peers, share insights, 
                and learn from each other. This team-oriented approach fosters a supportive environment where beginners can 
                ask questions and gain confidence in their coding abilities. You&apos;ll not only develop your technical skills 
                but also engage in problem-solving and critical thinking as you navigate the challenges of web scraping 
                together.
                </p><p id='project-text'>    
                Each contributor will be responsible for implementing a script to scrape different job posting websites 
                (i.e. Indeed, LinkedIn). Through this process, you will, hopefully, have a grasp on the some fundamental 
                HTML parsing.

                In this project, you will NOT be working with APIs or any web related technology. Those will be managed

                to a more complex project outside of school assignments. Also, you will NOT be working with any data and 
                their persistence (i.e. databases).
