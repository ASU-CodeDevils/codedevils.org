              Projects are an opportunity for members to collaborate on coding
              projects. Anyone can propose an idea for a project, and a project
              can be anything that involves coding in some way (regardless of

              Coding competitions are hosted each semester on HackerRank and our
              Discord server. Challenges range from easy to hard problems that
              may be solved using any supported programming language and give
              members a chance to win some swag while showing off their skills.
