# Before you create an Issue...

We're glad that you're here to report an issue with our project.  Please keep in mind, that many problems or inconsistencies with our code is known by our team.  Our Project Leads release issues to our contributors to keep consistent work available to our teams.  While outside issues are allowed, they will not be counted as contribution unless it is approved by the Project Lead.

## Reach out to the Project Lead

The best way to get your issue addressed as a contributor is to reach out to your Project Lead in your team channels.  You may often get automatic assignment to an issue that you identify ahead of an issue's posting, and a Project Lead may grant you extra points for having identified it.  

As an outside reviewer, you may create an issue for the project, but you MUST tag your issue with the tag "non-PL", or it will be closed.

# Template and Requirements

When creating an issue as an outside reviewer, please follow one of the following guides depending on your type of issue:

## Type 1:

Your issue is a Type 1 issue if you are simply noticing and reporting a problem with the project as a user.  Experienced bugs, broken things, etc.

- Issue Name: ```(USER PROBLEM) [Description of your issue]```
- Issue Description:
    Your issue description MUST contain a detailed explanation of the issue.  If there are any visual elements involved, screenshots or screen recordings of an issue replication MUST be included.

    **DO NOT** include any reference to the code with this issue type.  If you experience this issue, and have found a way to fix it, please leave it for our contributors to work out how they may debug the issue themselves.  If you would like to share your solution, please message the Project Lead.
- Labels: Your Issue must have the "non-PL" tag.

## Type 2:

Your issue is a Type 2 issue if you are reviewing the code as an outside reviewer and have a suggestion for how the code can be improved.

- Issue Name: ```(REVIEWER SUGGESTION) [Description of your suggestion]```
- Issue Description:
    Your issue description MUST contain the following:
    - A detailed description of the section of code needing improvement.
    - A reasonable explanation as to why it needs improvement.
    - Suggestions for improvement WITHOUT implementing the solution yourself.

    **DO NOT** include your own work in this issue type.  You simply need to point out a flaw in the code and tell us why you believe it needs to be improved and in what way.
- Labels: Your Issue must have the "non-PL" tag.
