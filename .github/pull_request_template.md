### My expectation
In the section "Home" of the website, I recognized that when I clicked "Learn More" in two sections "Community" and "Compete", it went to the same section 
"Our Online Community" in "About" of the website. Therefore, I wanted to add one section "Competitions" in "About" of the website that linked to the "Compete" section
in the "Home", and remained the section "Our Online Community" that linked to "Community". 
### Description of all changes in the pull request
- I have changed the section "Compete" into "Competitions" and changed href in that.
